## Outreach

<b>Keney Park Sustainability Project (KPSP)</b>
<br>I'm currently assisting the [Keney Park Sustainability Project (KPSP)](https://www.keneyparksustainability.org/), based out of Hartford, CT, with their beekeeping initiative. KPSP is a non-profit organization located in a federally designated Promise Zone. They aim to provide education about sustainable practices to the surrounding urban community through hands-on programs. KPSP currently has four thriving hives which are used for honey production and community education workshops!

<b>UConn Spring Valley Organic Student Farm</b>
<br>I love spending time at **UConn's Spring Valley**, a student run organic farm which hosts several hives (including our experimental hives in 2019). They focus on organic agriculture practices.

<b>Beekeeper Mentoring</b>
<br>Mentoring new beekeepers is something I also enjoy immensely. If you're interested in getting started, look for local beekeeping associations in your area or reach out to me with questions!

## Media

<b>UConn Today: The Psychologist and the Bees</b>
<br>I am very excited to share [a recent feature of myself and KPSP by UConn Today](https://today.uconn.edu/2020/09/the-psychologist-and-the-bees/)! Through service learning, academics are able to ground their work, practice their science communication with the broader community, and give back to others. I'd like to give my sincerest thank you to <b>Jaclyn Severance</b> (News & Information Officer) and <b>Thomas Rettig</b> (Multimedia Producer) from UConn Today for inviting me to take part in this project. Their efforts toward this piece shine through in the final production, and I can not thank them enough!

<br>I recently interviewed with the Editors of the IBACS (Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences) Digest on my experience with the 2019 Graduate Student Summer Fellowship. Check back for when the interview goes live!
