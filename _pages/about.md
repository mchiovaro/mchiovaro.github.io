I'm currently a Doctoral Candidate at the University of Connecticut in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), advised by [Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com). In the [Dynamics of Social Coordination and Inter-Organism Dependencies (dyscord) Lab](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/), we investigate social phenomena in dyads and groups from a dynamical systems perspective.

I was recently a Data Scientist Fellow for the U.S. Census Bureau, using criminal justice records and IRS returns to identify local labor market opportunities for individuals with criminal records. I'm currently a Fellow for the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication (SLAC)](https://slac.uconn.edu/) and awardee of an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I have affiliations with several other organizations, including the Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action, the Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy, and the Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I'm also an instructor for [SoftwareCarpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), a volunteer-run organization teaching computing skills to researchers and students across the globe.

My research interests include <i>social dynamics, collective intelligence, and action coordination</i> in goal-oriented settings. I harness **dynamical nonlinear methods** to capture the wildness and variability that is deep-rooted in social events. I integrate traditional laboratory experiments and naturally occurring datasets to investigate social coordination from new perspectives. Through these, my work disentangles the particular contexts and constraints which give rise to emergent coordination strategies, in turn leading to increased efficiency and better health outcomes in work groups.
