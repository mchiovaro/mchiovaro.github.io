I'm currently a second year graduate student at the University of Connecticut in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), advised by [Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com). In the [DYSCORD Lab](https://github.com/dyscord-lab/), we investigate social coordination in small and large groups, both human and non-human (invertebrate).

I'm currently a trainee for the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication (SLAC)](https://slac.uconn.edu/) and was recently awarded an **Honorable Mention** for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I'm also an instructor for [SoftwareCarpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), a volunteer-run organization teaching computing skills to researchers and students across the globe.

My research interests include <i>collective intelligence, social dynamics, and cross-species similarities during social coordination</i>. I'm particularly interested in using **nonlinear methods** to capture the wildness and variability that is deep-rooted in social events. My love for honey bees has led me to see <i>striking similarities in group phenomena</i> between these invertebrates and human collectives, particularly in the area of task-allocation. I aim to use insect groups and their methods of communication as a model for engineering more effective human work groups.
