I'm currently a second year graduate student at the University of Connecticut in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), advised by [Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com). In the DYSCORD Lab, we investigate social coordination in small and large groups, both human and non-human (invertebrate).

My research interests include <i>collective intelligence, social dynamics, and cross-species similarities during social coordination</i>. I'm particularly interested in using **nonlinear methods** to capture the wildness and variability that is deep-rooted in social events. My love for honeybees has led me to link <i>striking similarities in group phenomena</i> between these invertebrates and human collectives!
