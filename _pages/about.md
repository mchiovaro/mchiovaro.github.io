Welcome! I'm Megan Chiovaro, a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [SEACORP](https://www.seacorp.com/). Our team is working to bring **innovative AI/ML solutions** to DoD customers. I'm working alongside executives to establish an AI/ML Center of Excellence, creating collaboration and educational opportunities at SEACORP. I was also recently a Data Scientist Fellow for the U.S. Census Bureau, using ML to understand links between criminal justice records and IRS returns to identify local labor market opportunities for individuals with criminal records. I'm also an instructor for [SoftwareCarpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), a volunteer-run organization teaching computing skills to researchers and students across the globe.

In 2023, I earned my PhD in [Experimental Psychology](https://psych.uconn.edu/) from the University of Connecticut, where I was a part of the [Dynamics of Social Coordination and Inter-Organism Dependencies (dyscord) Lab](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/), investigating social phenomena in dyads and groups from a dynamical systems perspective. I'm a former Fellow of the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication (SLAC)](https://slac.uconn.edu/) and awardee of an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I have held affiliations with several other organizations, including the Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action, the Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy, and the Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences.

My academic research interests include <i>social dynamics, collective intelligence, and action coordination</i> in goal-oriented settings. I harness **dynamical nonlinear methods** and **machine learning** to capture the wildness and variability that is deep-rooted in sociality. I integrate traditional laboratory experiments and naturally occurring datasets to investigate social coordination from new perspectives. Through these, my work disentangles the particular contexts and constraints which give rise to emergent coordination strategies, in turn leading to increased efficiency and better outcomes in groups.
