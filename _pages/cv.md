## Community Involvement
* I'm currently assisting the [Keney Park Sustainability Project](https://www.keneyparksustainability.org/) based out of Hartford, CT with their beekeeping initiative.
* I also spend time at **UConn's Spring Valley**, a student run organic farm which hosts several hives (including our experimental hives).
* Mentoring new beekeepers is something I also enjoy immensely. If you're interested in getting started, look for local beekeeping associations in your area or reach out to me with questions!
