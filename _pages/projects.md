# Machine Learning Projects

## RAGify
As any type of engineer knows, documentation can often be lengthy and time consuming to sift through. Some olders PDFs are not even searchable. This is one of the reasons I'm working on [RAGify](https://github.com/mchiovaro/RAGify), a template for Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) applications. The current version of the app will perform OCR on any uploaded PDF, embed the text, build a temporary vector database, and perform RAG with assistance from pre-loaded LLMs. The offline nature of the app makes it viable for use with sensitive data, such as proprietary documentation. RAGify is an ongoing passion project. Please feel free to reach out with any requests or suggestions for functionality!

## Stock AIdvisor
Personal finance has always been a passion of mine. I'm a firm believer in accessible educational tools, hence the [Stock AIdvisor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mchiovaro/stock-aidvisor) was born! Just type in a description of a company and the app will identify the company you are most likely refering to, grab the ticker, download data on the stocks performance, and provide a financial analysis. This is intended to help individuals learn how to evaluate stocks and their viability as investment options. Stock AIdvisor is an ongoing project. Just like with RAGify, please feel free to reach out with any requests or suggestions!

# Academic Research Overview: What contexts and constraints give rise to successful leaderless group coordination?
A common theme across all of my academic research is the ways in which groups work together to achieve a common goal. Whether it's humans or honey bees, individuals coordinate their actions to achieve greater feats at faster speeds, even without an explicit leader. Identifying manipulatable factors to promote effective coordination strategies will allow workgroups to engineer their environments so as to increase efficiency and subsequently workplace health. Given recent shifts and advancements in online work teams and micro-blogging platforms, this question is increasingly important to disentangle in both the virtual and real world.
